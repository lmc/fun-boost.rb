fun-boost.rb

Picks a random class from your running code and swaps two methods with matching aritys so there's no nasty 'wrong number of arguments' errors. Good for hours of fun diagnosing random problems!

Usage:
require 'fun-boost'
That's it! fun-boost waits five minutes to allow your code to load and for you to start developing, then invokes fun once.
